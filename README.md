# Maximum subarray sum by flipping signs of at most K array elements




Given an array arr[] of N integers and an integer K. The task is to find the maximum sub-array sum by flipping signs of at most K array elements.


Input: arr[] = {-6, 2, -1, -1000, 2}, k = 2
Output: 1009
We can flip the signs of -6 and -1000, to get maximum subarray sum as 1009



Input: arr[] = {-1, -2, -100, -10}, k = 1
Output: 100
We can only flip the sign of -100 to get 100

Input: {1, 2, 100, 10}, k = 1
Output: 113
We do not need to flip any elements
